    <h2 id="tc1">What is Mobile-First Design?</h2>
    <p>Mobile-first design means creating websites and apps with mobile devices as the primary focus. This approach involves building the layout and core features for mobile screens first and then expanding the design for larger devices like tablets and desktops. By starting with the smallest screens, designers can ensure that essential content is presented clearly and efficiently.</p>

    <h2 id="tc2">Why is Mobile-First Design Essential?</h2>
    <p>With mobile devices now surpassing desktops in terms of web usage, itâ€™s more important than ever to prioritize mobile-friendly designs. A mobile-first approach ensures that websites load faster, are easier to navigate, and offer a more streamlined experience. This not only improves user engagement but also increases the chances of retaining visitors on mobile devices.</p>

    <h2 id="tc3">The Evolution of Web Design Approaches</h2>
    <p>In the past, websites were built with a desktop-first mindset, where designs were created for large screens and later adapted for smaller ones. This process, known as graceful degradation, often resulted in cluttered, difficult-to-navigate mobile websites. To overcome these challenges, the mobile-first approach emerged, where designers prioritize small screen experiences and then add more features for larger screens, ensuring that content is accessible and user-friendly across all devices.</p>

    <h2 id="tc4">Benefits of Mobile-First Design</h2>
    <p>By focusing on mobile-first design, developers can create websites that are not only responsive but also optimized for performance. It forces designers to remove unnecessary elements, highlighting only the most important content and features. As a result, users on smaller screens enjoy faster load times, a simpler interface, and better overall usability.</p>

    <h2 id="tc5">Conclusion</h2>
    <p>The shift towards mobile-first design is no longer optional but necessary in today's mobile-driven world. By adopting this approach, businesses can ensure their websites are accessible to the growing number of mobile users, delivering better experiences and staying ahead in a competitive digital landscape.</p>
