    <h2 id="what-is-the-internet">What is the Internet?</h2>
    <p class="p1"> The Internet is a vast network that connects computers all over the world. Through the Internet, people can share information and communicate from anywhere with an Internet connection.</p>
    <img src="images/internet1.jpg" alt="Description of the image"  class="im1">


    <h2 id="who-created-the-internet">Who created the Internet?</h2>
    <p> Unlike inventions like the phonograph or the safety pin, the internet doesn't have a single "creator." Instead, it developed gradually over time. Its origins can be traced back to the United States in the late 1960s, where it began as a military defense project during the Cold War. Initially, it served as a communication and data-sharing tool for scientists and researchers. Today, the internet is integral to nearly every aspect of our lives, and for many, it's hard to imagine a world without it.</p>
    <img src="images/internet2.jpg" alt="Description of the image" width="500">

    <h2 id="birth-of-arpanet">The birth of Arpanet</h2>
    <p> During the Cold War, tensions between the Soviets and Americans ran high, with both sides preparing for potential conflict. Scientists and military experts in the United States were particularly concerned about the possibility of a Soviet attack on the nation's telephone system. They feared that a single missile strike could wipe out the entire network of lines and wires that made efficient long-distance communication possible.</p>
    <p> In 1965, Donald Davies, a scientist at Britain’s National Physical Laboratory developed a way of sending information from one computer to another that he called “packet switching.”, each packet can take its own route from A to B. Without packet switching, the government’s computer network (now known as the Arpanet) would have been just as vulnerable to enemy attacks as the phone system.</p>
    
    <h2 id="first-message">The first message</h2>
    <p> On October 29, 1969, Arpanet delivered its first message: “LOGIN”. The first computer was located in a research lab at UCLA and the second was at Stanford, each one was the size of a large room. The message crashed the fledgling Arpanet and the Stanford computer only received the note’s first two letters.</p>

    <h2 id="network-grows">The network grows</h2>
    <p> By the end of 1969, just four computers were connected to the Arpanet, but the network grew steadily during the 1970s. In 1972, it added the University of Hawaii’s ALOHAnet, and a year later it added networks at London’s University College and the Norwegian Seismic Array. As packet-switched computer networks multiplied, however, it became more difficult for them to integrate into a single worldwide “internet.” By the mid-1970s, a computer scientist named Vinton Cerf had begun to solve this problem by developing a way for all of the computers on all of the world’s mini-networks to communicate with one another. He called his invention “Transmission Control Protocol,” or TCP. (Later, he added an additional protocol, known as “Internet Protocol.” The acronym we use to refer to these today is TCP/IP.) One writer describes Cerf’s protocol as “the ‘handshake’ that introduces distant and different computers to each other in a virtual space.”</p>

    <h2 id="world-wide-web">The World Wide Web</h2>
    <p> Cerf’s protocol transformed the internet into a worldwide network. Throughout the 1980s, researchers and scientists used it to send files and data from one computer to another. However, in 1991 the internet changed again. That year, a computer programmer working at the CERN research center on the Swiss-French border named Tim Berners-Lee introduced the World Wide Web: an internet that was not simply a way to send files from one place to another but was itself a “web” of linked information that anyone on the Internet could retrieve. Berners-Lee created the Internet that we know today.</p>
    <p> In 1992, a group of students and researchers at the University of Illinois developed a sophisticated browser that they called Mosaic. (It later became Netscape.) Mosaic offered a user-friendly way to search the Web: It allowed users to see words and pictures on the same page for the first time and to navigate using scrollbars and clickable links.</p>
    <p> That same year, Congress authorized the National Science Foundation to connect the country’s research- and education-focused internet services to commercial networks. As a result, companies of all kinds hurried to set up websites of their own, and e-commerce entrepreneurs began to use the internet to sell goods directly to customers. By the 2000s, companies including Amazon and eBay emerged as dominant players in the online retail space.</p>
    <p> In the first decade of the 2000s, social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram emerged, changing the way people connected, created and shared content. By around 2015, more people accessed the internet from smartphones than from other kinds of computers. By the early 2020s, companies, including OpenAI, Google, Microsoft and others starting rolling out advanced artificial intelligence systems to the public.</p>

    <h2 id="what-is-html">What is HTML? </h2>
    <p> HTML is a very evolving markup language and has evolved with various versions updating. Long before its revised standards and specifications are carried in, each version has allowed its user to create web pages in a much easier and prettier way and make sites very efficient.</p>
    <ul class ="list1">
        <li> <p>HTML 1.0 was released in 1993 with the intention of sharing information that can be readable and accessible via web browsers. But not many of the developers were involved in creating websites. So the language was also not growing.</p></li>
        <li> <p>Then comes HTML 2.0, published in 1995, which contains all the features of HTML 1.0 along with a few additional features, which remained the standard markup language for designing and creating websites until January 1997 and refined various core features of HTML.</p></li>
        <li> <p>Then comes HTML 3.0, where Dave Raggett introduced a fresh paper or draft on HTML. It included improved new features of HTML, giving more powerful characteristics for webmasters in designing web pages. But these powerful features of the new HTML slowed down the browser in applying further improvements.</p></li>
        <li> <p>Then comes HTML 4.01, which is widely used and was a successful version of HTML before HTML 5.0, which is currently released and used worldwide. HTML 5 can be said for an extended version of HTML 4.01, which was published in the year 2012.</p></li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="web-browsers">Web Browsers</h2>
    <p> A web browser is software that allows users to access and interact with the internet. It retrieves data from web servers and translates it into content such as text, images, and videos that can be displayed on devices.</p>

    <h2 id="mobile-first-design">Mobile-First Design</h2>
    <p> On the Mobile World Congress in 2010, Eric Schmidt, the CEO of Google, put forward that designers should follow the “mobile first” rule in product design. Mobile-first design means starting with the smallest screen sizes, like smartphones, when designing websites or apps. As mobile traffic now makes up over half of global internet usage, this approach ensures that web experiences are optimized for the majority of users.</p>
