    <h2 id="tc1">Introduction to CSS</h2>
    <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is one of the three cornerstone technologies of the web, alongside HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and JavaScript. The name CSS gives a hint at its role: "Cascading" refers to how styles can cascade from one rule to another, while "Style" describes how CSS defines the appearance of HTML elements.</p>
    <p>One of the key advantages of CSS is that multiple styles can be applied within a single HTML document, providing developers with great flexibility in how they design web pages.</p>

    <h2 id="tc2">What Does CSS Do?</h2>
    <p>CSS is responsible for defining how HTML elements are visually displayed on a webpage. While HTML handles the structure and content of a site, CSS is used to style that content, whether through fonts, colors, layouts, or other visual elements. This flexibility allows developers to craft visually appealing pages, such as using tabs across the top or side of a page, or employing different heading styles to make text stand out.</p>
    <p>Without CSS, web pages would be plain, uninspired, and difficult to read. In fact, before CSS, websites were nothing more than blocks of scrolling text. CSS revolutionized the way web pages look, contributing to the rich and interactive experiences we have today.</p>

    <h2 id="tc3">Why Do We Need CSS?</h2>
    <p>CSS ensures consistency across a website. Imagine a site with hundreds of pages where you had to manually define font sizes, colors, and layouts for each page. CSS eliminates that hassle by allowing developers to maintain consistent design choices across all pages and easily make site-wide changes.</p>
    <p>CSS also improves user experience by allowing developers to specify fonts, text colors, background colors, and the placement of content. Importantly, CSS ensures browser compatibility, enhancing accessibility and efficiency.</p>

    <h2 id="tc4">The Invention of CSS</h2>
    <p>The invention of CSS is credited to Norwegian Håkon Wium Lie, who in 1994 sought to create a universal style sheet standard for the web. The first browser to trial CSS was the Arena web browser, and from there, Lie went on to co-create CSS1, CSS2, and subsequent versions alongside web pioneers such as Tim Berners-Lee and Robert Cailliau.</p>
    <p>Since then, CSS has become a core part of web development, evolving alongside the internet itself to better shape and standardize the user experience.</p>

    <h2 id="tc5">The Evolution of CSS: CSS1, CSS2, and CSS3</h2>
    <p>CSS has gone through several key stages of development:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>CSS1 (1996): The original version of CSS allowed for basic styling such as font selection, text size, and color adjustments for text and backgrounds.</li>
        <li>CSS2 (1998): This version expanded CSS's capabilities by introducing features for designing page layouts.</li>
        <li>CSS3 (1999): CSS3 introduced more advanced features, including the ability to use multiple columns, rounded borders, and a wider range of fonts, such as those available through Google Fonts. CSS3 is modular, which makes it easier to use compared to earlier versions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="tc6">What About CSS4?</h2>
    <p>There is often confusion about the existence of "CSS4." While some refer to post-CSS2 developments as CSS3 and CSS4, it’s more accurate to say that there has never been an official CSS4 version. Instead, the W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) continually adds new modules and features to CSS without grouping them into an entirely new version. These ongoing updates ensure that CSS keeps pace with the changing needs of the web.</p>

    <h2 id="tc7">How to Learn CSS</h2>
    <p>CSS is a language like any other, and learning it is similar to learning a spoken language like French or Japanese. While developers don’t need to memorize every piece of CSS code, understanding key concepts and using reference tools like CSS property guides can make the learning process smoother. With enough practice, anyone can learn to use CSS effectively to create beautiful, functional web pages.</p>

    <h2 id="tc8">Conclusion: The Web Without CSS</h2>
    <p>Without CSS, the web would be a much more basic and uninspiring place. CSS gives web developers the tools to design engaging, visually appealing websites, much like adding color and decoration to a house made only of plain bricks. It’s the key to transforming the "vanilla" web into the rich, diverse, and stimulating medium we enjoy today.</p>
